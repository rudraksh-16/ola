Ola Booking Analysis 

Project Overview --------------------------->

Hello, I am Saurav Singh, an AI/ML enthusiast. This is my Ola Booking Analysis project, which I developed after learning key concepts from the Top VarSity YouTube channel. After understanding the core ideas, I applied additional operations independently to enhance the analysis.

This project is a data analytics study on Ola ride bookings in June 2024. The analysis aims to derive meaningful insights from the ride booking data by leveraging Excel, MySQL, and Power BI. The project follows a structured approach, including data cleaning, SQL-based analysis, and interactive dashboard creation.


Tools & Technologies Used ------------------------------------------------->

Microsoft Excel – Data cleaning and preprocessing

MySQL – Data storage and query execution for insights
